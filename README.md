# Sudoku GUI Solver
Welcome to the Sudoku GUI Solver project! This application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for solving Sudoku puzzles. With the Sudoku GUI Solver, users can input Sudoku puzzles, visualize the solving process, and generate solutions for both simple and complex Sudoku grids.

## Features
1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Offers a user-friendly interface for inputting Sudoku puzzles, displaying the solving process, and visualizing the solution.

2. **Sudoku Input:** Allows users to input Sudoku puzzles manually or by importing them from external files (e.g., text files).

3. **Solving Algorithms:** Implements efficient algorithms to solve Sudoku puzzles, including backtracking, constraint propagation, and depth-first search.

4. **Step-by-Step Solution:** Provides a step-by-step solution display, allowing users to follow the solving process and understand each step taken to solve the puzzle.

5. **Solution Verification:** Verifies the correctness of the solution generated by the solver, ensuring that it adheres to the rules of Sudoku (no repeated digits in rows, columns, or boxes).

6. **Customization Options:** Offers customization options such as grid size, solving speed, and visual themes to tailor the solving experience to user preferences.

## Installation
To run the Sudoku GUI Solver locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/RadinaAvramova/Sudoku-GUI-Solver.git

2. **Navigate to the Directory:** Change your current directory to the location of the cloned repository:

cd Sudoku-GUI-Solver

3. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Run the Application:** Run the Sudoku GUI Solver Python script:

python GUI.py

5. **Access the Application:** Once the application is running, you can interact with the Sudoku GUI Solver through the graphical user interface.

## Usage
1. **Input Sudoku Puzzle:** Input the initial Sudoku puzzle either manually by clicking on the grid cells or by importing a puzzle from an external file.

2. **Solve Sudoku Puzzle:** Click the "Solve" button to initiate the solving process. The solver will attempt to find a solution for the given puzzle.

3. **View Solution:** Once the solving process is complete, the solution will be displayed on the grid, and users can verify its correctness.

4. **Step-by-Step Solution:** Use the "Step" button to visualize each step of the solving process, allowing users to understand how the puzzle is solved.

5. **Customization:** Adjust settings such as grid size, solving speed, and visual themes to customize the solving experience.

## Customization
You can customize the Sudoku GUI Solver by modifying aspects such as the GUI layout, solving algorithms, solving speed, and visual themes. Additionally, you can add new features or enhancements to improve the functionality and usability of the solver
